## Installation

1. put everything into $HOME
2. debug all the errors that will inevitably arise
3. install whatever is missing
4. repeat 2-3 until it works or you trash it and just start from scratch

    
## Roadmap (if i ever get around to it)
- decide what needs to stay and what can probably go

- replace using a fresh installations on a clean OS (oh-my-zsh/p10k are probably the most egregiously messy)

- add some documentation on what is installed where
